# CounterSocial

CounterSocial is the first Social Network Platform to take a zero-tolerance stance to hostile nations, bot accounts and trolls who are weaponizing OUR social media platforms and freedoms to engage in influence operations against us. And we're here to counter it.

We operate from a modified, hardened node and infrastructure, we are unafraid to engage in offensive countermeasures. We actively block nodes and access to our community from IP space originating in Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Pakistan and Syria, along with over 100,000 VPN and proxy services.


# FOR DEVELOPERS

API Documentation for this fork is located here: https://github.com/th3j35t3r/CounterSocial/blob/master/docs/API/API.md

# HISTORY

CounterSocial was originally forked off the Mastadon codebase. The repository you are viewing (https://github.com/th3j35t3r/CounterSocial/tree/master) is a very early fork of the Mastadon code base which allowed the owner to explore the project and how one can implement the OStatus protocol in a social media site. _As one will see from the commit history, is unmaintained and retained only for historical significance and licensing compliance._

# FUTURE VISION
The current plan moving forwards is that the CounterSocial site will completely move away from using any of the Mastadon code base at all, and instead will be a completely seperate and original product suite inspired by the GNU Social project, and related social media products such as Mastadon, Pleroma, PostActiv, Friendi.ca and identi.ca which implement the OStatus open messaging standard. You can learn more about the OStatus standard by the W3C at https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/wiki/images/9/93/OStatus_1.0_Draft_2.pdf and https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/wiki/Main_Page. Given this could be read by someone at anytime, there is already a good chance that the site you see at https://counter.social already isn't using any of this code at all. Don't expect that you'll get CounterSocial if you build from the source in this repo. At best, it'll be really buggy as it's well behind the original Master. It certainly should not be used for production servers, and if you really like Mastadon, you can grab a copy here https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon, or grab one of the other fine products using OStatus from around the web. If you really like the idea of CounterSocial, come join us, or hell - make your own. OStatus is open and implementable by anyone. (Don't fork this and submit pull requests - as stated above, this repo is now static.)

At the time of writing, CounterSocial is not a part of the Fediverse due to both network level security limitations which form a core part of the service, and active blocking of CounterSocial from the (open) Fediverse due to unwarranted objections and delisting/blocking from the Mastadon portion of the Fediverse by Tootsuite, the maintainers of the Mastadon sourcecode.

# Well dayumm, so CounterSocial must be somehow violating the (A)GPL license then?

No. Under the terms of the (A)GPL license anyone is free to modify the original code in ANY way they choose, so long as they "make an opportunity to receive the corresponding source code available from a network server at no charge" - which CounterSocial complies with, as outlined in our Terms of Service, right here in this repo. The (A)GPL license has no authority, legal or implied, to determine how external but connected hardware or software, such as, but not limited to firewalls, WAFs, traffic filtering are implemented or configured.

_It should be noted that at every turn, the developers of CounterSocial sought to be active and contributing members of the Mastadon community, albeit with quite strict network security against hostile state actors - states which are now internationally accepted at the highest levels as actively and regularily engaging in cyber-warfare and information warfare campaigns against social media platforms across the world, particular those hosted in countries who are members of the "5 Eyes" Alliance._

# Who defines these rules, anyways?

CounterSocial is a private entity. As a private entity, CounterSocial can configure security for its hardware/software assets and users as it see's fit, including firewalls, traffic filtering WAF's etc. CounterSocial is not required to grant protections aside from those stated in our Terms of Service and/or End User License Agreement, which can be changed at any time, for any reason.
